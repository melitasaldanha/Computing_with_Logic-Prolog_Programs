# README

This folder contains the following prolog programs:
## Family:
1. Check if X is the mother of Y
2. Check if X is the father of Y
3. Check if X is the grandparent of Y
4. Check if X is the grandmother of Y
5. Check if X is the sibling of Y
6. Check if X is the aunt of Y
7. Check if X is the cousin of Y
8. Check if X is the ancestor of Y

## Trees:
1. Print vertices of trees in preorder arrangement
2. Print vertices of trees in postorder arrangement
3. Print vertices of trees in inorder arrangement

## Graphs:
1. Are X and Y adjacent nodes in the graph
2. Find path from given source to destination node
3. Given a source node, find the path of a cycle from the source node to itself
4. Find the degree of the given node
5. Sort all nodes of the graph in ascending order of degree

## Difference List:
1. Append Difference lists
2. Add an element to a difference list
3. Check if list is a palindrome
4. Print vertices of trees in preorder arrangement
5. Print vertices of trees in postorder arrangement
6. Print vertices of trees in inorder arrangement

## other_programs_list_1:
1. Check if we can reach node B from node A
2. Check if X is a member of list Y
3. Append lists (L3 = L1+L2)
4. Find length of list
5. Find factorial of a number
6. Quicksort
7. Quicksort using cut
8. Delete an element from a list
9. Find all permutations of elements in a list

## other_programs_list_2:
1. Find last element of a list
2. Find kth element of a list
3. Reverse a list
    - More complex
    - Complexity reduced
4. Check if X is a Palindrome
5. Flatten a nested list
6. Eliminate consecutive duplicates
7. Pack: Given a flattened list with duplicate elements, form a nested list with consecutive elements packed as a list
8. Encode: Given a list with consecutive duplicate values, return a list of (Length, Value) for consecutive elements
9. Decode: Given an encoded list of (Length, Value) for consecutive duplicate elements, return a decompressed list
10. Return list of integers of a list between a given range

## other_programs_list_3:
1. Given a number, find the 2 prime numbers which sum upto to the given number [Goldbach's conjecture states: Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes]
2. K-coloring algorithm: Given a graph, color the nodes of the graph such that adjacent nodes have different colors
3. Find GCD of all numbers in the list
